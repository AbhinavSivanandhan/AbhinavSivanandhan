## Highlighted Projects

### 🛒 LLM-Powered Digital Marketplace with Priority-Based Checkout Queue  
*(Node.js, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, S3, GCP, AWS EC2, Stripe, LangChain.js, Datastax, OpenAI, Winston, Node-cron, Nodemailer)*  

Developed and deployed a scalable, event-driven e-commerce platform with a microservices-based architecture, leveraging asynchronous processing and Redis caching for high performance. Implemented secure, stateless authentication and role-based access control(RBAC) using JWT and bcryptjs, along with custom rate limiting middleware, and S3 bucket-based static asset management via pre-signed URLs with upload quotas. Designed automated background workers using Node-cron for scheduled tasks and message queue consumers for order processing using RabbitMQ. Enabled transactional email notifications with Nodemailer. Enhanced product retrieval with an LLM-powered RAG chatbot built using Next.js, LangChain.js, Datastax, and OpenAI. Ensured scalability and observability with Winston logging and deployed to AWS EC2.

### 🛠️ SoloStack: AI-Powered DevOps Dashboard  
*(Terraform, AWS Lambda, Python, Streamlit, Perplexity Sonar API, CloudWatch, IAM, S3, VPC)*  

Built a zero-config AI-powered DevOps dashboard to optimize AWS infrastructure costs, security, and governance for small businesses and indie developers. Integrated cost monitoring, unused resource detection, and AI-generated Terraform refactoring. Parsed CloudWatch logs to recommend optimizations using Perplexity Sonar API. Automated security checks across IAM, S3, and VPC. Enabled live infra-to-code conversion and AI-driven risk summaries. Deployed using a custom Terraform pipeline with a Streamlit frontend. As it is portable, it's currently deployed to the same environment as the Digital Marketplace project.

### 🎨 Social Media Platform for Artists  
*(React, AWS Kinesis, DynamoDB, Amplify, Cognito)*  

Developed a scalable, GraphQL-based microservices platform for artists with real-time collaboration features and a personalized recommendation engine. Integrated AWS services to ensure high performance and scalability.  

### 📊 FDA Drug Reaction Analysis  
*(Dask, Spark, DuckDB, PyArrow, Parquet)*  

Designed and implemented a distributed big-data ETL pipeline to process and analyze **500GB+** of highly nested JSON data related to adverse drug events. Leveraged **Dask** and **PyArrow** to efficiently flatten and convert the data into a **distributed Parquet-based relational format**, enabling fast querying and scalable exploratory analysis. Utilized **Spark** for parallel processing and optimized big data workflows.  

### 📸 Deep Learning Image Classification App  
*(ResNet50, MobileNetV2, Flask, Kubernetes)*  

Built and deployed an image classification application using deep learning models. Utilized **Kubernetes for container orchestration** and **dynamic scaling**, achieving **99.68% availability** and high performance with **28.54 transactions/sec**.  

### 🍕 Culinary Compass  
*(Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL)*  

Created a RESTful recipe recommendation system that leverages both **content-based and collaborative filtering** to deliver personalized suggestions. Built with a **Next.js frontend** and a **Django backend**.  

### 🌱 Open Source Contributions - PrairieLearn  
*(Python, TypeScript, Mustache)*  

Enhanced the online test-taking platform (widely adopted by multiple top universities including NYU) with **intuitive frontend features** and UI improvements using **Python, TypeScript, and Mustache**, applying **test-driven development (TDD)**.  

### 🤝 Hangout Event Planner  
*(MERN Stack, Google Calendar)*  

Developed an interactive **event planning and scheduling app** with a **RESTful API suite**. Integrated **Google Calendar** to streamline event organization and scheduling workflows.
